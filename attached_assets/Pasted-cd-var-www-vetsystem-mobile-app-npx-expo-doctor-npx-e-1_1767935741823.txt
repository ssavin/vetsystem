✖ Check for common project setup issues
The .expo directory is not ignored by Git. It contains machine-specific device history and development server settings and should not be committed.
Advice:
Add ".expo/" to your .gitignore to avoid committing local Expo state.

✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Errors validating fields in /var/www/vetsystem/mobile-app/app.json:
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'compileSdkVersion'.
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'targetSdkVersion'.
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'minSdkVersion'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-font
Required by: @expo/vector-icons
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install expo-font"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.
